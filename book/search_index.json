The following graphic provides us with some history of these domains. This is helpful if you are trying to orient yourself in the world of analytics and machine learning. Note that AI has been around for quite some time. The Wikipedia definition of AI is: The study of “intelligent agents”: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals 1.1 Machine Learning Machine Learning relies upon “patterns and inference”\" to “perform a specific task without using explicit instructions”. It is a form of Applied AI that attempts to automatically learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. Think of Predictive Modeling as a subset of this which falls into two categories: Supervised Algorithms that build a model on a set of data containing both the inputs and the desired outputs (“labels” or known numeric values). When you want to map input to known output labels. Build a model that, when applied to “new” data, will hopefully predict the correct label. Some common techniques for Supervised learning include: Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and K Nearest Neighbors. Unsupervised Algorithms that take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data (e.g. clustering of data points) Some common techniques for unsupervised learning include: hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, mixture models, DBSCAN, Association Rules, Neural Networks 1.2 Predictive Modeling This lecture is concerned primarily with Predictive Modeling and Supervised approaches in particular. Some examples of Predictive Modeling include: Predict current CD4 cell count of an HIV-positive patient using genome sequences Predict Success of Grant Applications Use attributes of chemical compounds to predict likelihood of hepatic injury How many copies of a new book will sell ? Will a customer change Internet Service Providers ? In this domain there are generally two types of predictive models. Classification for Predicting Qualitative Outcomes: This relates to situations such as whether someone has a disease (“positive”) or not (“negative”). The problem could also be multi classification such as assigning an organism to one of a number of possible species. Regression for Quantitative Out Comes This is when we wish to predict a numeric / continuous outcome such as a final sales price for a house or car. It might also be a prediction of tomorrow’s stock or Bit Coin price. 1.3 In-Sample vs Out-Of-Sample Error The goal of predictive model is to generate models that can generalize to new data. It would be good if any model we generate could provide a good estimate of out of sample error. It’s easy to generate a model on an entire data set (in sample data) and then turn around and use that data for prediction. But how will it perform on new data ? Haven’t we just over trained our model ? 1.4 Performance Metrics For either case (regression vs classification) we need some type of metric or measure to let us know how well a given model will work on new or unseen data - also known as “out of sample” data. for Classification problems we look at things like “sensitivity”, “specificity”, “accuracy”, and “Area Under Curve”. For Quantitative outcomes, we look at things like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The selection of metric will frequently depend on your domain of interest. We’ll use a couple of different methods. 1.5 Black Box The good news is that you can treat building predictive models as a “Black Box”. The bad news is that you can treat building predictive models as a “Black Box”. "],

Our defining question or driving motivation might be how to predict whether someone will be postitive for diabetes based on other variables within the data. Is glucose, for example, an important variable to consider ? In lookin at the data, there is a variable in the data called “diabetes” which indicates the disease / diabetes status (“pos” or “neg”) of the person. It would be good to come up with a model that we could use with incoming data to determine if someone has diabetes. 2.1 Important Terminology In predictive modeling there are some common terms to consider: 2.2 Exploratory Plots We’ll look use some stock plots from the DataExplorer package to get a feel for the data.

This is not the only way to proceed but it is used by many professional Data Scientists. 3.1 Splitting The Data A fundamental approach used in ML is to segment data into a “training” set which is some percentage of the original data - say 80%. The remaining 20% would be assigned to a “test” data set. Then we build a model on our training data set after which we use that model to predict outcomes for the test data set. This looks like the following. Note that some scenarios will split the data into three data sets: 1) training, 2) validation, and 3) test. This scenario is used when tuning so called hyper parameters for methods that have “tuning” parameters that could influence the resulting model. We’ll stick with the basic “train / test” approach for now. Splitting the data is not particularly challenging. We can use the built in sample function in R to do this. We aren’t sampling with replacement here which guarantees that no record can exist in both sets. That is, if a record from the data set is assigned to the training set, it will not be in the test data set. # Make this example reproducible set.seed(123) percent &lt;- .80 # Get the indices for a training set. idx &lt;- sample(1:nrow(pm),round(.8*nrow(pm)),F) # Use bracket notation to create the train / test pair train &lt;- pm[idx,] test &lt;- pm[-idx,] # The following should have 80 percent of the original # data round(nrow(train)/nrow(pm)*100) ## [1] 80 3.2 First Model Now let’s build a Generalized Linear Model to do the prediction. We will employ logistic regression. myglm &lt;- glm(diabetes ~ ., data = train, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) summary(myglm) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = diabetes ~ ., family = &quot;binomial&quot;, data = train) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.4798 -0.7300 -0.4281 0.7420 2.9493 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

For now, we’ll keep going because we are trying to outline the larger process / workflow. 3.3 First Prediction 3.3.1 A Stumbling Block For New Comers We could now use this new model to predict outcomes using the test data set. Remember that we are attempting to predict a binary outcome - in this case whether the person is positive for diabetes or negative. What we get back from the prediction object are probabilities for which we have to determine a threshold above which we would say the observation is “positive” for diabetes and, below the threshold, “negative”. probs &lt;- predict(myglm, newdata = test, type = &quot;response&quot;) probs[1:10] ## 1 3 9 17 22 27 28 32 ## 0.70756327 0.79695675 0.74524797 0.36330982 0.31803457 0.74106187 0.04892642 0.56777794 ## 42 43 ## 0.68427254 0.11927265 With logistic regression we are dealing with a curve like the one below which is a sigmoid function. The idea is to take our probabilities, which range between 0 and 1, and then pick a threshold over which we would classify that person as being positive for diabetes. In this context, we have a continuum. 3.3.2 Selecting The Correct Alpha The temptation is to select 0.5 as the threshold such that if a returned probability exceeds 0.5 then we classify the associated subject as being “positive” for the disease. But then this assumes that the probabilities are distributed accordingly. This is frequently not the case though it doesn’t stop people from using 0.5. Another way to view this is as follows. This graphic shows a “perfect” classifier which more or less matches the logit function above: Note that this is a rare situation wherein our model has given us a clean separation between negative and positive cases. We could have something like this: Or this: Or even this: One thing we should do here is to look at the distribution of the returned probabilities before making a decision about where to set the threshold. We can see clearly that selecting 0.5 in this case would not be appropriate. boxplot(probs, main=&quot;Probabilities from our GLM Model&quot;) grid() The median is somewhere around .25 so we could use that for now although we are just guessing. mypreds &lt;- ifelse(probs &gt; 0.25,&quot;pos&quot;,&quot;neg&quot;) mypreds &lt;- factor(mypreds, levels = levels(test[[&quot;diabetes&quot;]])) mypreds[1:10] ## 1 3 9 17 22 27 28 32 42 43 ## pos pos pos pos pos pos neg pos pos neg ## Levels: neg pos 3.3.3 Confusion Matrices Next, we would compare our predictions against the known outcomes which are stored in the test data frame: # How does this compare to the truth ? table(predicted = mypreds, actual = test$diabetes) ## actual ## predicted neg pos ## neg 66 9 ## pos 36 43 What we are doing is building a “Confusion Matrix” which can help us determine how effective our model is. From such a matrix table we can compute a number of “performance measures”, such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity and others, to help assess the quality of the model. In predictive modeling we are always interested in how well any given model will perform on “new” data. There are some functions that can help us compute a confusion matrix. Because the variable we are trying to predict, (diabetes), is a two level factor, (“neg” or “pos”) we’ll need to turn our predictions into a comparable factor. Right now, it’s just a character string. # test$diabetes &lt;- ordered(test$diabetes,c(&quot;pos&quot;,&quot;neg&quot;)) # mypreds &lt;- factor(mypreds, # levels=levels(test$diabetes)) caret::confusionMatrix(mypreds,test$diabetes,positive=&quot;pos&quot;) ## Confusion Matrix and Statistics ## ## Reference ## Prediction neg pos ## neg 66 9 ## pos 36 43 ## ## Accuracy : 0.7078 ## 95% CI : (0.6292, 0.7782) ## No Information Rate : 0.6623 ## P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : 0.1335015 ## ## Kappa : 0.4205 ## ## Mcnemar&#39;s Test P-Value : 0.0001063 ## ## Sensitivity : 0.8269 ## Specificity : 0.6471 ## Pos Pred Value : 0.5443 ## Neg Pred Value : 0.8800 ## Prevalence : 0.3377 ## Detection Rate : 0.2792 ## Detection Prevalence : 0.5130 ## Balanced Accuracy : 0.7370 ## ## &#39;Positive&#39; Class : pos ## 3.4 Performance Measures Revisited This is helpful stuff although there are a number of measures to select as a primary performance metric. Ideally, we would already know which performance metric we would select to effectively “judge” the quality of our model. In medical tests, “sensitivity” and “specificity” are commonly used. Some applications use “Accuracy” (which isn’t good when there is large group imbalance). Anyway, if, for example, we pick “sensitivity” as a judge of model quality we see that is somewhere around .87. (A much deeper discussion about selecting the best performance measure is in order but we’ll keep moving for now) The problem here is that all we have done is looked at the confusion matrix corresponding to one specific (and arbitrary) threshold value when what we need is to look at a number of confusion matrices corresponding to many different thresholds. For example, we might get a better sensitivity level had we selected the mean of the returned probabilities. This process could go on and on and on… So we would benefit from a rigorous approach to find the “best” threshold. 3.5 The ROC curve One way to do this is to use something known as the ROC curve. Luckily, R has functions to do this. This isn’t surprising as it is a standard tool that has been in use for decades long before the hype of AI and ML was around. The ROC curve gives us a “one stop shop” for estimating a value of alpha that results in maximal area under a curve. In fact, maximizing the area under a given ROC curve winds up being an effective way to judge the differences between one method and another. So, if we wanted to compare the glm model against a Support Vector Machine model, we could use the respective AUC (Area Under Curve) metric to help us. This isn’t the only way to do this but it’s reasonable for now. pred &lt;- ROCR::prediction(predictions = probs, labels = test$diabetes) perf &lt;- performance(pred, &quot;tpr&quot;, &quot;fpr&quot;) plot(perf,colorize=T, print.cutoffs.at=seq(0,1,by=0.1), lwd=3,las=1,main=&quot;Cool ROC Curve&quot;) abline(a = 0, b = 1) grid() myroc &lt;- performance(pred,measure=&quot;auc&quot;) myroc@y.values[[1]] ## [1] 0.8508673 So what value of alpha corresponds to the stated max AUC of .80 ? We’ll have to dig into the performance object to get that but it looks to be between 0.30 and 0.40. Note that this is somewhat academic since knowing the max AUC alone helps us decide if our model is any “good”. For completeness we could use another R function to nail this down: library(pROC) proc &lt;- roc(test$diabetes,probs) round(coords(proc, &quot;b&quot;, ret=&quot;t&quot;, transpose = FALSE),2) ## threshold ## 1 0.36 Generally speaking, here is a graphic which shows you some ROC curve shapes and how they relate to AUC.

["other-methods.html", "Chapter 4 Other Methods ? 4.1 Improving The Model(s) 4.2 Cross Fold Validation", " Chapter 4 Other Methods ? Well, we could use another method to see if it yields better performance as determined by the AUC. Let’s use the ranger function which is a fast implementation of random forests. One thing you will notice is that we need to include the “probability” argument in the call to ranger to get the necessary probabilities for computing the AUC. This is one of the aggravations with using different functions. They all have their own peculiar way of doing things. library(ranger) ranger_mod &lt;- ranger(diabetes ~ ., data = train, probability = TRUE,mtry=4) # Returns probabilities ranger_pred &lt;- predict(ranger_mod,data=test) myroc &lt;- roc(test$diabetes, ranger_pred$predictions[,2]) myroc$auc ## Area under the curve: 0.8407 pred &lt;- ROCR::prediction(ranger_pred$predictions[,2], test$diabetes) perf &lt;- performance(pred, &quot;tpr&quot;, &quot;fpr&quot;) plot(perf,colorize=T, print.cutoffs.at=seq(0,1,by=0.1), lwd=3,las=1,main=&quot;Cool ROC Curve&quot;) abline(a = 0, b = 1) grid() rroc &lt;- performance(pred,measure=&quot;auc&quot;) rroc@y.values[[1]] ## [1] 0.8406863 It turns out that this didn’t appear to improve things - at least with one invocation of the method. 4.1 Improving The Model(s) We haven’t accomplished very much here because we need to look at multiple versions of the data in case we sampled a number of outliers in the creation of our training data. Or, maybe we have excluded a large number of outliers in the training set so they wound up in the test data set which means that the predictive power of our model isn’t as robust as it should be. Our next steps should involve creating multiple versions of the training and test pairs (say 3 times), compute the optimal AUC, and then look at how those values vary for each of those individual versions. If the AUCs vary widely then maybe our model is over training. If it’s not varying widely, it could be that that the model has high bias. 4.2 Cross Fold Validation This is a method that gives us multiple estimates of out-of-sample error, rather than a single estimate. In particular, we’ll use an approach called “K-Fold Cross Validation” where we will partition our data into 3 individual “folds”\" which are basically equal in size. Then we’ll create a loop that does the following: Combines 2 of the folds into a training data set Builds a model on the combined 2-folds data Applies the model to holdout fold Computes the AUC value and stores it Each fold is simply a portion of the data. We’ll generate a list called “folds” that contains 3 elements each of which are 256 index elements corresponding to rows in pm. The way we did the sample insures that each row shows up only in one fold. Here is our function to implement the K-Fold validation. It’s pretty straightforward to define in terms of coding though it winds up being somewhat specific to the particular method we are using. Still, we could give it an argument to accept different methods. cross_fold &lt;- function(numofolds = 3) { # Function to Do Cross fold validation # Split the data into K folds (numofolds) folds &lt;- split(sample(1:nrow(pm)),1:numofolds) # We setup some blank lists to stash results folddf &lt;- list() # Contains folds modl &lt;- list() # Hold each of the K models predl &lt;- list() # Hold rach of the K predictions auc &lt;- list() # Hold the auc for a given model # Create a formula that can be used across multiple # iterations through the loop. myform &lt;- &quot;diabetes ~ .&quot; for (ii in 1:length(folds)) { # This list holds the actual model we create for each of the # 10 folds modl[[ii]] &lt;- glm(formula = myform, data = pm[-folds[[ii]],], family = &quot;binomial&quot; ) # This list will contain / hold the models build on the fold predl[[ii]] &lt;- predict(modl[[ii]], newdata=pm[folds[[ii]],], type=&quot;response&quot;) # This list will hold the results of the AUC per iteration pred &lt;- ROCR::prediction(predl[[ii]], pm[folds[[ii]],]$diabetes) roc &lt;- performance(pred,measure=&quot;auc&quot;) auc[[ii]] &lt;- roc@y.values[[1]] } return(unlist(auc)) } Running this is now quite simple. By default, this function will loop three times corresponding to the number of folds. During each iteration it will: use glm to build a model on the training folds create a prediction object using the training fold compute the underlying AUC associated with the prediction store the AUC in a vector At the end of the function, the vector containing the computed AUCs will be returned. set.seed(123) cross_fold() ## [1] 0.8537200 0.8290205 0.7944576 # Use more folds set.seed(123) cross_fold(8) ## [1] 0.8674473 0.8032407 0.7715248 0.8680715 0.7972689 0.8523886 0.8361111 0.8111111 We could take the average of the AUCs to get a sense of how well this method would apply to unseen data. set.seed(123) mean(cross_fold(8)) ## [1] 0.8258955 Let’s plot the individual values: stripplot(cross_fold(8), main=&quot;AUC values for K-Fold Validation&quot;, type=c(&quot;g&quot;,&quot;p&quot;),pch=19,cex=1.5) So, there are functions in R that will implement K-fold cross-validation for you but they involve their own specific interface. There is the “cv.glm” function which does cross validation on GLM models. There is also the “bagging.cv” function tht does the same with Bagging. "],

In R, as well as with Python, there are a growing number of packages available to help simplify repetitive processes. Building predictive models is no exception especially given that so many sub processes are involved such as splitting data, building a model, making a prediction, comparing it to the labelled data, and so on. The caret package provides an easy point of entry into the world of predictive modeling. It provides the following features: - Streamlined and consistent syntax for more than 200 different models - Can implement any of the 238 different methods using a single function - Easy data splitting to simplify the creation of train / test pairs - Realistic model estimates through built-in resampling - Convenient feature importance determination - Easy selection of different performance metrics (e.g. &quot;ROC&quot;,&quot;Accuracy&quot;, &quot;Sensitivity&quot;) - Automated and semi-automated parameter tuning - Simplifed comparison of different models The caret package was designed specifically for predictive modeling and, in particular, to provide an intuitive approach to creating, managing, and comparing different models emerging from various methods. Let’s work through our previous examples using functions from caret. 5.1 Data Splitting Using Caret Let’s split the data into a training / test pair. The caret package provides some useful functions for this one of which is the CreateDataPartition function. idx &lt;- createDataPartition(pm$diabetes, p=.80, list=FALSE) Train &lt;- pm[idx,] Test &lt;- pm[-idx,] nrow(Train) ## [1] 615 Now we can use this to create a training object with caret. We’ll create a GLM model similar to the one we’ve already created. The primary, and most frequently used, function in caret is the train function. In this example we’ll use it build a model using the glm method. We will also specify that “Accuracy” will be the preferred performance measure. myglm_caret &lt;- train(diabetes ~ ., data = Train, method = &quot;glm&quot;, metric = &quot;Accuracy&quot;) myglm_caret ## Generalized Linear Model ## ## 615 samples ## 8 predictor ## 2 classes: &#39;neg&#39;, &#39;pos&#39; ## ## No pre-processing ## Resampling: Bootstrapped (25 reps) ## Summary of sample sizes: 615, 615, 615, 615, 615, 615, ... ## Resampling results: ## ## Accuracy Kappa ## 0.7590927 0.4449503 We get a lot for our money.

To do this requires the specification of a “control” object which contains information that we would like for the train function to consider as it does its work. Not every invocation of train requires an associated trainControl object although as you become more experienced building models, you will frequently use this approach. control &lt;- trainControl(method = &quot;cv&quot;, number = 5) myglm_caret &lt;- train(diabetes ~ ., data = Train, method = &quot;glm&quot;, metric = &quot;Accuracy&quot;, trControl = control) myglm_caret ## Generalized Linear Model ## ## 615 samples ## 8 predictor ## 2 classes: &#39;neg&#39;, &#39;pos&#39; ## ## No pre-processing ## Resampling: Cross-Validated (5 fold) ## Summary of sample sizes: 492, 492, 492, 492, 492 ## Resampling results: ## ## Accuracy Kappa ## 0.7642276 0.4587416 5.3 Inspecting The Model The object returned by caret has a great deal of information packed into it much of which is there to support reproducibility. Some key aspects of the object include, in this case, the Accuracy computation for each fold. myglm_caret$resample ## Accuracy Kappa Resample ## 1 0.7967480 0.5249498 Fold1 ## 2 0.7154472 0.3424469 Fold2 ## 3 0.7642276 0.4551703 Fold3 ## 4 0.7723577 0.4884135 Fold4 ## 5 0.7723577 0.4827275 Fold5 myglm_caret$results ## parameter Accuracy Kappa AccuracySD KappaSD ## 1 none 0.7642276 0.4587416 0.02987183 0.06959971 # Note that the final reported Accuracy metric is simply the average of # the reported Accuracy values for each fold myglm_caret$results[2] == mean(myglm_caret$resample$Accuracy) ## Accuracy ## 1 TRUE Of course, you can always look at the model itself to get summary information just as you could if you were not using the train function. That is, the caret package does not try to conceal or replace what could be done using standard approaches. It overlays the model with information in a way that is transparent. summary(myglm_caret) ## ## Call: ## NULL ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.5895 -0.7228 -0.4200 0.7493 2.8819 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Remember that one of the features of using caret is that it can help us estimate the out of sample error we will experience when applying our model to new or unseen data. The above model provides an estimate of out of band accuracy as .77 myglm_caret ## Generalized Linear Model ## ## 615 samples ## 8 predictor ## 2 classes: &#39;neg&#39;, &#39;pos&#39; ## ## No pre-processing ## Resampling: Cross-Validated (5 fold) ## Summary of sample sizes: 492, 492, 492, 492, 492 ## Resampling results: ## ## Accuracy Kappa ## 0.7642276 0.4587416 Let’s create a prediction object using the Test data to see how close we came to this estimate. It’s a little worse than caret’s estimate which is to be expected. Also, this is just an estimate using a single threshold when using the predict function. There are more sophisticated ways to estimate the accuracy. mypreds_glm &lt;- predict(myglm_caret, Test) # Create a Table of known outcomes vs the predicted outcomes outcome &lt;- table(preds=mypreds_glm,actual=Test$diabetes) (acc_outcome &lt;- sum(diag(outcome))/sum(outcome)) ## [1] 0.7973856 5.5 Comparing Performance Across Other Methods The advantage of the train function is that we can use the same control objects across a number of modeling techniques which then makes it easier to compare performance across various methods. As an example, instead of using the “glm” method we could pick another one such as Decision Tree. All we need to know is the name of the method we want. A complete list of supported models listed by category can be found here control &lt;- trainControl(method = &quot;cv&quot;, number = 5) myrpart_caret &lt;- train(diabetes ~ ., data = Train, method = &quot;rpart&quot;, metric = &quot;Accuracy&quot;, trControl = control) myrpart_caret ## CART ## ## 615 samples ## 8 predictor ## 2 classes: &#39;neg&#39;, &#39;pos&#39; ## ## No pre-processing ## Resampling: Cross-Validated (5 fold) ## Summary of sample sizes: 492, 492, 492, 492, 492 ## Resampling results across tuning parameters: ## ## cp Accuracy Kappa ## 0.02093023 0.7284553 0.3931155 ## 0.11162791 0.7154472 0.3492746 ## 0.23720930 0.6991870 0.2679068 ## ## Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value. ## The final value used for the model was cp = 0.02093023. myrpart_caret_preds = predict(myrpart_caret,Test) So we also need to do some predictions on the Test data set to see how well the model works on unseen data. This model has good specifity but not so good with the sensitivity. confusionMatrix(myrpart_caret_preds,Test$diabetes,positive=&quot;pos&quot;) ## Confusion Matrix and Statistics ## ## Reference ## Prediction neg pos ## neg 88 23 ## pos 12 30 ## ## Accuracy : 0.7712 ## 95% CI : (0.6965, 0.8352) ## No Information Rate : 0.6536 ## P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : 0.001098 ## ## Kappa : 0.4689 ## ## Mcnemar&#39;s Test P-Value : 0.090969 ## ## Sensitivity : 0.5660 ## Specificity : 0.8800 ## Pos Pred Value : 0.7143 ## Neg Pred Value : 0.7928 ## Prevalence : 0.3464 ## Detection Rate : 0.1961 ## Detection Prevalence : 0.2745 ## Balanced Accuracy : 0.7230 ## ## &#39;Positive&#39; Class : pos ## This method employs a Decision Tree approach which also involves use of “hyper parameters”. However, at this point we don’t really need to know much about those (although we should) when selecting the method. The larger point is that all we need to know is the name of the alternative method and we can reuse the previous control object. 5.6 Different Performance Measures Not only can we easily select different methods we can also select different performance measures. It does require changes to the control object and arguments to the train function though we do not need to read the underlying help pages for a given method to do this. This is a true convenience and time saver that makes reproducing these experiments much easier. In this example we want to use the “Area Under Curve” (AUC) metric that comes from an associated ROC curve. To do this will require the model to generate class probabilities from which to build the ROC curve so this information needs to be specified in the control object. control &lt;- trainControl(classProbs = TRUE, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary, method = &quot;cv&quot;, number = 8) myglm_caret_roc &lt;- train(diabetes ~ ., data = Train, method = &quot;glm&quot;, metric = &quot;ROC&quot;, trControl = control) myglm_caret_roc ## Generalized Linear Model ## ## 615 samples ## 8 predictor ## 2 classes: &#39;neg&#39;, &#39;pos&#39; ## ## No pre-processing ## Resampling: Cross-Validated (8 fold) ## Summary of sample sizes: 538, 538, 538, 538, 538, 538, ... ## Resampling results: ## ## ROC Sens Spec ## 0.8293661 0.88 0.5532407 This is a true convenience and we don’t have to use a separate R package to compute the AUC. It becomes a by product of the modeling process. One subtlety with the above is the way caret looks at the levels of the diabetes column. It looks at them as “neg” and “pos” which leads to a switch between the sensitivity and specificity. An example will make this clear. Let’s do predictions on the training data: train_myglm_preds &lt;- predict(myglm_caret_roc,Train) caret::confusionMatrix(train_myglm_preds,Train$diabetes,positive=&quot;pos&quot;) ## Confusion Matrix and Statistics ## ## Reference ## Prediction neg pos ## neg 351 92 ## pos 49 123 ## ## Accuracy : 0.7707 ## 95% CI : (0.7354, 0.8034) ## No Information Rate : 0.6504 ## P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : 6.565e-11 ## ## Kappa : 0.4714 ## ## Mcnemar&#39;s Test P-Value : 0.0004046 ## ## Sensitivity : 0.5721 ## Specificity : 0.8775 ## Pos Pred Value : 0.7151 ## Neg Pred Value : 0.7923 ## Prevalence : 0.3496 ## Detection Rate : 0.2000 ## Detection Prevalence : 0.2797 ## Balanced Accuracy : 0.7248 ## ## &#39;Positive&#39; Class : pos ## Let’s see how it performs on the Test data test_myglm_preds &lt;- predict(myglm_caret_roc,Test) caret::confusionMatrix(test_myglm_preds,Test$diabetes,positive=&quot;pos&quot;) ## Confusion Matrix and Statistics ## ## Reference ## Prediction neg pos ## neg 89 20 ## pos 11 33 ## ## Accuracy : 0.7974 ## 95% CI : (0.7249, 0.858) ## No Information Rate : 0.6536 ## P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : 7.169e-05 ## ## Kappa : 0.5339 ## ## Mcnemar&#39;s Test P-Value : 0.1508 ## ## Sensitivity : 0.6226 ## Specificity : 0.8900 ## Pos Pred Value : 0.7500 ## Neg Pred Value : 0.8165 ## Prevalence : 0.3464 ## Detection Rate : 0.2157 ## Detection Prevalence : 0.2876 ## Balanced Accuracy : 0.7563 ## ## &#39;Positive&#39; Class : pos ## Specifically, the control object can remain the same across different methods assuming that we wish to continue with classification.

"],
["feature-importance.html", "Chapter 6 Feature Importance", " Chapter 6 Feature Importance Another advantage of using the caret train function is that it provides a method to determine variable importance. This is useful when considering what features to include or not when building a model. If we summarize a given model, our myglm_caret model, we’ll see that some of our predictors are not significant. We could use the varImp to use statistics generated by the specific modeling process itself. For more complex modeling techniques this winds up being very useful since digging into the model diagnostics can be daunting - although quite useful. varImp(myglm_caret) ## glm variable importance ## ## Overall ## glucose 100.000 ## mass 63.719 ## pregnant 44.532 ## pedigree 28.932 ## pressure 27.731 ## age 9.651 ## insulin 5.656 ## triceps 0.000 If you wanted to see how the different models rates the significance of predictor variables then you can easily plot them. library(gridExtra) p1 &lt;- plot(varImp(myglm_caret),main=&quot;varImp for glm&quot;) p2 &lt;- plot(varImp(myrf_caret),main=&quot;varImp for Rf&quot;) grid.arrange(p1,p2,ncol=2) 6.0.1 Feature Elimination The caret package also supports “recursive feature elimination” which automates the selection of optimal features. This can be controversial since such a process could work at the expense of important statistical considerations. However, it remains a tool in the Machine Learning toolbox. Let’s work though an example of this using caret functions. First, we’ll remove highly correlated predictor variables from consideration. We don’t really have a lot of highly correlated variables. It turns out that “age” is correlated with “pregnant” at a level of 0.54. plot_correlation(pm[,1:8], type=&quot;continuous&quot;) # find attributes that exceed some spcified threshold highlyCorrelated &lt;- findCorrelation(cor(pm[,1:8]), cutoff=0.5, names = TRUE) # print indexes of highly correlated attributes print(highlyCorrelated) ## [1] &quot;age&quot; 6.0.2 The rfe Function Let’s apply the RFE method on the Pima Indians Diabetes data set.

["comparing-models.html", "Chapter 7 Comparing Models", " Chapter 7 Comparing Models One of the more frequent activities in Machine Learning relates to setting up “shoot outs” between different models to see which one will perform the best. This is something we could do without caret but the package does help accomplish this using a standard interface. We’ll keep using the Pima Indians Data and (re)build a few models.

In particular, the company H20.ai provides frameworks for accessible Machine Learning by experts and non-experts. They promote the idea of “citizen data science” which seeks to lower barriers to participation in the world of AI. While they have a commercial product, they also provide an open source tool: H2O is a fully open source, distributed in-memory machine learning platform with linear scalability. H2O supports the most widely used statistical &amp; machine learning algorithms including gradient boosted machines, generalized linear models, deep learning and more. Moreover, H2O provides access to an “Auto ML” service that selects methods appropriate to a given data set. This is useful to help jump start ideas. H2O also has an industry leading AutoML functionality that automatically runs through all the algorithms and their hyperparameters to produce a leaderboard of the best models. The H2O platform is used by over 18,000 organizations globally and is extremely popular in both the R &amp; Python communities. Better yet, there is an R package called, somewhat unimaginatively, “h2o” “which provides: R interface for ‘H2O’, the scalable open source machine learning platform that offers parallelized implementations of many supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as Generalized Linear Models, Gradient Boosting Machines (including XGBoost), Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks (Deep Learning), Stacked Ensembles, Naive Bayes, Cox Proportional Hazards, K-Means, PCA, Word2Vec, as well as a fully automatic machine learning algorithm (AutoML). 8.1 H2O In Action The package must first be installed which can done using the install.packages function (or the menu in R Studio). Loading the library is done just as you would any other library. library(h2o) The goal of using this library is not to replace the methods available to you in R but, just like the caret package, seeks to provide a uniform interface for a variety of underlying methods. This includes common methods including an “Auto ML” service that picks methods for you. Let’s apply h2o to our work. The underlying h2o architecture uses a “running instance” concept that can be initialized and accessed from R. You initialize it once per interactive session. h2o.init() H2O is not running yet, starting it now...

This will take the form of using R functions provided by the h2o package to read in data and prepare it for use with various methods. Let’s repeat the regression on mtcars using h2o functions. Since mtcars is already available in the the R environment we can easily import it into h2o. # Import mtcars pm_h2o_df &lt;- as.h2o(pm) # Idenitfy the variable to be predicted y &lt;- &quot;diabetes&quot; # Put the predictor names into a vector x &lt;- setdiff(colnames(pm_h2o_df),y) 8.2 Create Some Models Now let’s create some training and test data sets.

Here we’ll request a 4-Fold, Cross Validation step as part of the model assembly. h2o_glm_model &lt;- h2o.glm(y=y,x=x,train_h2o,nfolds=4,family=&quot;binomial&quot;) summary(h2o_glm_model) Model Details: ============== H2OBinomialModel: glm Model Key: GLM_model_R_1608222700875_6444 GLM Model: summary family link regularization number_of_predictors_total 1 binomial logit Elastic Net (alpha = 0.5, lambda = 4.842E-4 ) 8 number_of_active_predictors number_of_iterations training_frame 1 8 4 RTMP_sid_9938_1608 H2OBinomialMetrics: glm ** Reported on training data. ** MSE: 0.1445039 RMSE: 0.3801367 LogLoss: 0.4460641 Mean Per-Class Error: 0.221113 AUC: 0.8553703 AUCPR: 0.7687956 Gini: 0.7107406 R^2: 0.365502 Residual Deviance: 544.1982 AIC: 562.1982 Confusion Matrix (vertical: actual;

You could extract pieces of information from the S4 object but saving the model is easy to do - as is reading it back in. model_path &lt;- h2o.saveModel(h2o_glm_model,path=getwd(),force=TRUE) # If you need to load a previously saved model saved_model &lt;- h2o.loadModel(model_path) 8.4 Using the Auto ML Feature Are you curious as to what model might be the “best” for your data ? This is a very fertile field of research that keeps growing and some feel will one be the dominant technology in ML - where a model picks a model. Sounds odd but that is where it is heading. Check the current h2o Auto ML documentation for more details. For now, most of the Auto ML services use a set of heuristics to examine data and then find the most appropriate method to build a model. The currently supported method implementations in the open source version include: - three pre-specified XGBoost GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine) models - a fixed grid of GLMs, a default Random Forest (DRF) - five pre-specified H2O GBMs - a near-default Deep Neural Net - an Extremely Randomized Forest (XRT) - a random grid of XGBoost GBMs - a random grid of H2O GBMs - a random grid of Deep Neural Nets. 8.5 Launching A Job Of course, it all begins with the idea of specifying a performance metric such as RMSE or the area under a ROC curve. The idea here is that we specify some input, apply transformations, create a test/train pair, and then call the h2o auto function. h20_pm_model &lt;- h2o.automl(y = y, x = x, training_frame = train_h2o, leaderboard_frame = test_h2o, max_runtime_secs = 60, seed = 1, sort_metric = &quot;AUC&quot;, project_name = &quot;pm2&quot;) Let’s check out the object that is returned. It is an S4 object in R which means that it has “slots” which can be accessed via the “@” operator. slotNames(h2o_auto_pm) [1] &quot;project_name&quot; &quot;leader&quot; &quot;leaderboard&quot; &quot;event_log&quot; &quot;modeling_steps&quot; [6] &quot;training_info&quot; h2o_auto_pm@leaderboard model_id auc logloss aucpr 1 GBM_grid__1_AutoML_20201217_162611_model_4 0.8043091 0.5049815 0.6544545 2 GBM_grid__1_AutoML_20201217_162823_model_4 0.8043091 0.5049815 0.6544545 3 XRT_1_AutoML_20201217_162611 0.7987892 0.5119855 0.6036122 4 XRT_1_AutoML_20201217_162823 0.7987892 0.5119855 0.6036122 5 DeepLearning_grid__3_AutoML_20201217_162823_model_1 0.7964744 0.5162976 0.6133439 6 GBM_grid__1_AutoML_20201217_162611_model_7 0.7962963 0.5119919 0.6594433 mean_per_class_error rmse mse 1 0.2546296 0.4137757 0.1712103 2 0.2546296 0.4137757 0.1712103 3 0.2560541 0.4174395 0.1742558 4 0.2560541 0.4174395 0.1742558 5 0.2508903 0.4162580 0.1732707 6 0.2457265 0.4140577 0.1714438 [80 rows x 7 columns] &gt; Stop the H2O instance h2o.shutdown(prompt=FALSE) "]
